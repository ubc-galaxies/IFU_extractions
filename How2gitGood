# Steps condensed from: https://swcarpentry.github.io/git-novice/index.html
# Topic NOT covered here: Ignore files, set up ssh, resolving conflicts


## Step 1: Configure
$ git config --list # What needs to be edited?

## Step 2: Creat git controlled folder locally and on github
cd Git_cntrl
$ git init # Initialize git control in local repo

## Step 3: Switch to main branch. NOTE: master is no more!
$ git checkout -b main

## Step 4: setup origin to push to remote github repo
$ git remote add origin git@github.com:ubc-galaxies/IFU_extractions.git

# Check the connections was made
git remote -v

## Step 5: add and commit files, all commits are stored locally until pushed to remote repo
$ git add file.txt anotherfile.py # add multiple files or just one
$ git commit -m "Comment on commit"

# Calls to examine changes
$ git log # list all commits
$ git diff # show retractions "--" and additions "++" 
$ git diff f22b25e file.txt # list difference in file.txt since commit f22b25e (the 1st 7 digits of the commit string listed next to each commit in "git log"
$ git checkout f22b25e file.txt # restore file.txt to the version stored in commit f22b25e 
$ git diff HEAD~# file.txt # show differences between file.txt in your working repo and file.txt in the commit # ago ex: HEAD~1 = 'show difference between file.txt now and 1 commit ago'

# Github no longer supports password authentication, can either set up ssh (see above link) or generate a personal token 
Github Profile -> settings -> developers setting -> personal access tokens -> Tokens (classic) -> fill out expiration date and authentications -> Generate Token -> copy Token and paste when prompted for password when you push (step 6)

## Step 6: Push changes to Github
$ git push -u origin main

## Step whenever: Pull changes from the remote repo on Github
$ git pull origin main # Downloads changes from remote repo to your local repo

## Collaborating 
# Add a collaborator/give access to your remote repo
# In remote repo
Settings > Add people > Search for their name

# Accept access
Go to https://github.com/notifications or check for email notification

# Clone the repo
$ git clone git@github.com:ubc-galaxies/IFU_extractions.git ~/path/to/save/repo/locally

## Rinse, wash, and repeat
